# Snippet samples

For Evolve with its automation script. These are some sample scripts to use with my [my snippet system](https://github.com/kewne7768/evolve_automation).

They don't have full QA or anything, and no guarantee that they're relevant at all prestige levels/challenge types.

(This is stuff I'm using as I work on making it so it should work to some extent, but not 100%.)

Stuff in _teststuff/ is unlikely to have a practical use in its current form.
